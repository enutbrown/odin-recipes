    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Our favorite recipe for making a classic apple pie from scratch. This 
            recipe guarantees apple pie with perfectly cooked (not mushy) apples 
            surrounded by a thickened and gently spiced sauce all baked inside a 
            flaky, golden-brown crust. </p>
        <p>It’s taken us a while to zero in on our favorite method for making apple 
            pie, but I think we’ve finally nailed it. This simple recipe guarantees 
            perfectly cooked apples surrounded with a thick gently spiced sauce. 
            There’s no need for precooking the sauce or apples and the steps to make 
            this pie are simple, you just need a little time.</p>
